# Organization-Design

The gold standard for organization design is Valve. Why? Their profit and revenue per employee is higher than that of Apple or Google. They have lower employee flight risk and tremendously long tenures compared to Silicon Valley as a whole. More importantly, they've managed to grow and scale without major VC backing (self-funded). They are also one of the largest companies in the world that's privately owned but manages to be #4 bandwidth consumer in the world. In early 2010s, Steam itself had about a $1B run rate. They are the closest we have to holocracy in business.
